Kustomize is a tool that lets you create an entire Kubernetes application out of individual pieces — without touching the YAML for the individual components.  For example, you can combine pieces from different sources, keep your customizations — or kustomizations, as the case may be — in source control, and create overlays for specific situations. And it will be part of Kubernetes 1.14.

Kustomize enables you to do that by creating a file that ties everything together, or optionally includes “overrides” for individual parameters.
